# SuperBenefit Sourcecred

This repository contains an instance of [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/), a tool for measuring and rewarding engagement and value creation in digital communities.

This instance is currently used for the Energy Efficiency Project. You can earn cred by engaging with the community on Discord and GitHub through the following actions:

- Posting in the WREEP chat chnnels on the SuperBenefit Discord server
- Using the official WREEP GitHub repos to create issues, comment, submit pull requests, etc

Cred generated by this instance is for *reputation tracking* only. In the future, we may drop a valueless community token to prove participation in our residential energy nft pilot program. Any allocations of future tokens will be based on several factors, including cred earned in this instance.

## Plugins

Sourcecred uses **plugins** to gather information from apps used by SuperBenefit.

### Discord

The **Discord Plugin** gathers information from SuperBenefit's Discord server to calculate reputation metrics based on Discord engagement.

The Plugin fetches data related to **messages** and **reactions** from specific **channels**. **Messages** receive a lower weight than **reactions**, meaning that you will receive more reputation points (cred) when more members react to your posts. You'll also receive a small amount of cred when you react to others' posts.

#### Channel Weights

Currently only channels in the Wreep category are tracked by sourcecred. The default weight for messages to channels in this category is **1 point**. Weights for other channels are as follows:

- **#wreep-core**
: 0.125 points  
- **#wreep-community**
: 2 points  

#### Discord Reaction Weights
